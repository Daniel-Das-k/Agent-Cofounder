    "content": "I'm exploring the idea of smart glasses for visually imparied people and honestly, I'm not sure if this is a real problem or just my own frustration.\n\nI'm currently in the market research phase, trying to understand the needs of professionals in this space. I haven't built anything yet, just trying to learn.\n\nI keep running into issues with the current assistive technology. It takes me a lot of time to adjust and I end up with a frustrating outcome.\n\nWhat I'm trying to figure out:\n• Is this actually a widespread problem?\n• How do others currently handle related tasks?\n• Would you be interested in a solution for this?\n\nAnyone else dealing with this, or am I the only one? I'm open to any feedback or suggestions you might have.",
