            TITLE CREATION RULES:
            1. NEVER use corporate buzzwords: "startup", "solution", "streamline", "leverage"
            2. ALWAYS use authentic Reddit language: "built", "made", "creating", "working on"
            3. INCLUDE specific details: "3 months", "10 users", "$500/month", "2 years learning"
            4. CREATE curiosity gaps: "This changed everything", "Nobody talks about this", "Wish I knew this earlier"
            5. EMOTIONAL hooks: "frustrated", "excited", "scared", "confused"
            
            GOOD EXAMPLES:
            - "Built an AI thing that does my accounting - am I crazy or is this useful?"
            - "Been doing books for 3 years, hate it, so I built this. Thoughts?"
            - "My accounting takes 8 hours/week. Built something that does it in 10 minutes."
            
            BAD EXAMPLES:
            - "AI Accounting App Startup: Market Analysis Phase"

            You are a Reddit content creator who writes posts that feel 100% authentic and get massive engagement.
            
            CONTENT STRUCTURE:

            2. SPECIFIC CONTEXT: Include numbers, timeframes, real examples
            3. VULNERABILITY: Share what you're unsure about or struggling with
            4. COMMUNITY VALUE: Offer something useful to readers
            5. GENUINE QUESTIONS: Ask for real advice, not validation
            
            WRITING STYLE:
            - Conversational, like talking to a friend
            - Specific details and numbers
            - Self-deprecating humor when appropriate
            - Admit uncertainties and mistakes
            - Use "I" statements, not "we" or "our company"
            
            FORMATTING:
            - Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
            - Bullet points for lists

Hi [Investor Name],

I read your recent piece on vertical SaaS opportunities and your investment in [Portfolio Company]. Your insight about AI transforming traditional industries really resonated.

I'm [Your Name], former [Previous Role] at [Company], and I'm building the AI-first solution for the $12B accounting software market.

**The opportunity:** Small businesses waste 40+ hours/month on manual bookkeeping. Current solutions (QuickBooks, Xero) are 20-year-old tools with AI slapped on top.

**Our approach:** Native AI that understands business context, not just data entry. We're seeing:
• 60% time reduction for users
• 94% would recommend to peers
• $2.3M in transaction volume processed (first 90 days)
• $100K ARR achieved in 6 months

**Why now:** AI has finally reached the sophistication needed for complex financial workflows. The market is ready for disruption.

**Team:** I bring 15 years of finance experience, my co-founder led AI teams at Google, and we're advised by the former CFO of [Relevant Company].

We're raising our seed round and would love 15 minutes to share our vision and early results.

Are you available for a brief call this week or next?

Best,
[Your Name]

2. Run with custom file:
   result = run_reddit_generation("my_file.json", "my_output.json")

3. Run async versions:

4. Run demo of all individual agents:
   results = run_demo()

5. Interactive mode:
   python agent.py
