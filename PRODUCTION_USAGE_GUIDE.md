## 🔧 Error Handling

### Automatic Retry for:
- **503 Service Unavailable**: Model overloaded
- **429 Rate Limit**: API quota exceeded
- **Timeout Errors**: Network issues
- **500 Server Errors**: Temporary API issues

### Non-Retryable Errors:
- **401 Authentication**: Invalid API key
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input data
- **File Not Found**: Missing session file

### Error Recovery Tips:
```bash
# API quota exceeded
💡 API quota exceeded. Try again later or upgrade your plan.

# Authentication failed  
💡 Check your GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable.

# Session file missing
💡 Make sure 'enhanced_cofounder_session.json' exists in current directory.
```

## 📈 Monitoring & Logs

### Log Levels
- **INFO**: Normal operations, successful generations
- **WARNING**: Recoverable issues, retries
- **ERROR**: Failed operations, non-retryable errors

### Log Examples
```
2025-07-09 17:19:49,259 - INFO - Session validated - Startup: 'smart glasses for visually impaired people', Phase: 'market'
2025-07-09 17:19:52,237 - INFO - ✅ Strategic analysis completed successfully
2025-07-09 17:19:59,521 - INFO - ✅ X content generation completed successfully
```

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Watch logs in real-time
tail -f logs/content_generation.log

# Check recent errors
grep "ERROR" logs/content_generation.log | tail -10

# Count successful generations
grep "completed successfully" logs/content_generation.log | wc -l
```

## 🔄 Advanced Configuration

### Custom Retry Settings
```python
from production_agent import ProductionContentOrchestrator

# Custom retry configuration
orchestrator = ProductionContentOrchestrator(
    max_retries=10,        # More retries
    base_retry_delay=1.0,  # Faster initial retry
    max_retry_delay=120.0  # Longer max delay
)
```

### Batch Processing
```python
import asyncio
from production_agent import generate_reddit_production

# Process multiple session files
session_files = ["session1.json", "session2.json", "session3.json"]

async def batch_generate():
    tasks = []
    for session_file in session_files:
        task = generate_reddit_production(
            file_path=session_file,
            output_file=f"output/{session_file.replace('.json', '_reddit.json')}"
        )
        tasks.append(task)
    
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    return results

# Run batch processing
results = asyncio.run(batch_generate())
```

## 🛡️ Best Practices

### 1. **Session Data Quality**
- Ensure `startup_idea` is descriptive and specific
- Include relevant `key_market_insights` if available  
- Keep session data up-to-date with your actual progress

### 2. **API Management**
- Monitor your API usage and quotas
- Use appropriate retry delays to avoid rate limits
- Set up billing alerts for quota management

### 3. **Output Management**
- Regularly backup your generated content
- Use version control for important content
- Archive old content to prevent directory bloat

### 4. **Error Recovery**
- Check logs first when troubleshooting
- Verify session file format before running
- Test with single platform before running all

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: `FileNotFoundError: enhanced_cofounder_session.json`
```bash
# Solution: Create or locate your session file
ls -la enhanced_cofounder_session.json
```

**Issue**: `Authentication failed`
```bash
# Solution: Set your API key
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
echo $GEMINI_API_KEY  # Verify it's set
```

**Issue**: `Service overloaded (503)`
```bash
# Solution: The system will retry automatically
# Watch the logs to see retry attempts
tail -f logs/content_generation.log
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check Logs**: `logs/content_generation.log`
2. **Verify Session Data**: Validate JSON format
3. **Test API Key**: Try a simple generation first
4. **Monitor Quotas**: Check your API billing dashboard
